# AvanzaTech Blog üíªÔ∏è
AvanzaTech Blog is a blogging platform built with Django in the backend, utilizing a RESTful architecture. The backend offers services such as user authentication, permission management for resource access, and CRUD operations for blog posts. Additionally, users can create, read, and delete likes and comments associated with the posts.

## Setup Environment üõ†Ô∏è <a name="setup"></a>
**1**. Clone the repository in your local environment
```sh
# Clone repository
$ git clone git@github.com:mariovelandiac/avanzatech_blog
```
**2**. Create a database in your local environment, Postgresql is recommended, however, any relational database engine could be used
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE avanzatech_blog_db;
```
**3**. Create your own ```.env``` file based on ```.envexample``` file in the repository
```sh
# Copy the .envexample file to create your own .env file
$ cp .envexample .env
```
Set the ```.env``` file with the required fields. The database's user should have permissions to create tables and insert rows in the database
```text
DB_NAME=avanzatech_blog_db
DB_USER=username
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=host
DB_PORT=port
SECRET_KEY=secret_key
```
**4**. Start the virtual environment with ```pipenv```
```sh
# Create virtual environment
$ pipenv --python $(which python3) install
```
This project requires Python version 3.10 or 3.11. If you don't have either of these versions in your local environment, you can install it with:
```sh
# Install Python version 3.x.y
$ pipenv --python 3.x.y install
```
**5**. Start the virtual environment
```sh
# Start virtual environment
$ pipenv shell
```
**6**. Install dependencies
```sh
# Install dependencies
$ pipenv install
```
**7**. Generate the migrations in the database and apply them
```sh
# Generate migrations
$ python manage.py makemigrations
# Apply the migrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```
**8**. Create a superuser to access the admin panel. When you run this command, the prompt will ask you for an email, a password, and a username. The email and the password will be used for logging in to the site admin.
```sh
# Create Superuser
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
**9**. Now you can run the development server
```sh
# Run development server
$ python manage.py runserver
```
**Note**: By default, the Django development server (`runserver`) will be listening on port 8000 on localhost.
## Admin Panel üöî <a name="admin"></a>
Once you have created a superuser in the 8th step in the last section, you can now log in with your email and password. The admin panel allows you to create, edit, list, and delete entities for every application related to the project. The related applications include:
- User
    - Blogger
    - Admin
- Post
- Team
- Comment
- Like
Additionally, from this panel, an admin user can be created by activating the `is_staff` attribute in the User-panel creation. To log in into the Django admin panel site you need to access
```text
http://localhost:8000/admin
```
**Note**: Just superusers have access to admin panel. When logged in as a superuser in the admin panel, you also gain admin access to the Blog post API, granting you unrestricted access to all resources. Admin users have special permissions but they don't have access to admin panel
## Log in ‚úÖ <a name="login"></a>
From the admin panel, you can create a blogger user and log in with their credentials at:
```text
http://localhost:8000/user/login
```
Once you log in as a `blogger`, the admin session will be closed automatically. If you want manually logout, you can access to this endpoint:
```text
http://localhost:8000/user/logout
```
## Endpoints üö™ <a name="endpoints"></a> 
The following endpoints allow to interact with the resources through the RESTful API
### Create a Blog Post üìù <a name="create-post"></a>
- To create a blog post, you need to be authenticated and send an `HTTP POST` request to this endpoint:
```text
http://localhost:8000/blog/
```
- The payload must follow this template
```json
{
    "title": "post title",
    "content": "post content",
    "read_permission": "public"
}
```
- `title` field must not be empty
- For the `read_permission` field, you can set it to one of the following options. Any other option will return in a bad request response
    - `public`
    - `authenticated`
    - `team`
    - `author`
- The author of the post will be automatically set to the logged in user
### Edit a Blog Post ‚úèÔ∏è <a name="edit-post"></a>
- To edit a blog post, you need to be authenticated as the owner of the post or as an admin user and send an `HTTP PUT` request to this endpoint:
```text
http://localhost:8000/blog/<int:pk>
```
- Replace `<int:pk>` with the integer that identifies the post
- The payload must follow this template
```json
{
    "title": "post title",
    "content": "post content",
    "read_permission": "public"
}
```

    - `public`
    - `authenticated`
    - `team`
    - `author`
### List Blog Posts üìã <a name="list-post"></a>
- To retrieve a list of blog posts,  send an `HTTP GET` request to this endpoint:
```text
http://localhost:8000/blog/
```
- If you are not authenticated, you will only see `public` post
- If you are authenticated, you will see:
    - `authenticated` posts.
    - Posts of your own team with `read_permission` set as `team`.
    - Your own posts, whether marked as `author` or not.
- The response of the API looks like this:
```json
{
    "count": 23,
    "next": "http://localhost:8000/blog/?page=2",
    "previous": null,
    "results": [
        {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Post Title",
            "content": "This is the title of the post",
            "user": 5,
            "read_permission": "authenticated",
            "created_at": "2024-01-30T17:07:53.962903Z"
        },
        {
            "id": 2,
            "title": "Public POst",
            "content": "This is the title of a public post",
            "user": 5,
            "read_permission": "public",
            "created_at": "2024-01-30T17:07:45.379470Z"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```
- `count`: Returns the total number of available posts
- `next` and `previous`: Provide links to the next and previous pages of results, respectively. The API returns `10` results per page by default. You can adjust the page size up to `50` results with the query parameter `page_size`, like this
```text
http://localhost:8000/blog/?page_size=23
```
- The order of the results is by the most recent post by default
